## 1.	What is semantic HTML and why is it important? Can you provide examples of semantic HTML5 tags?
```
Semantic HTML refers to the use of HTML markup that carries meaning about the structure and content of a web page. The term "semantic" in this context refers to the meaning or purpose of the content, rather than just its presentation. Semantic HTML helps both browsers and developers understand the structure and hierarchy of the content, making it more accessible, maintainable, and search engine-friendly. {or}
The core characteristic of a semantic element is that it clearly communicated its meaning to both the developer and the browser. These elements clearly define its content. 

```
1. `<header>`: Represents the header of a section or a page. It often contains headings, logos, navigation, and other introductory content.
2. `<nav>`: Represents a navigation menu. It's typically used to define a set of navigation links.
3. `<main>`: Represents the main content of the document. It should not include headers, footers, or sidebars.
4. `<article>`: Represents a self-contained piece of content that could be distributed and reused independently, such as a news article or blog post.
5. `<section>`: Represents a generic section of a document. It is often used to group related content.

### Page Structure

- How would you structure a basic webpage layout using HTML? Describe the purpose of elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<section>`.

```
A basic webpage layout typically includes the <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <section>, <aside>, and <footer> structural elements.
 The purpose of elements :
 <header>: Contains the main heading or logo of the webpage.
<nav>: Represents a navigation menu, containing links to different sections of the webpage.
<main>: Contains the main content of the webpage, including articles, sections, and an aside.
<article>: Represents a self-contained piece of content.
<section>: Represents a generic section of content.
<aside>: Contains content that is tangentially related to the content around it, such as a sidebar.
<footer>: Contains footer information, often including copyright notices and links to terms of service.
This structure provides clarity and semantic meaning to different parts of the webpage, making it more accessible and understandable for both browsers and developers.

###  Explain the CSS box model. How do the padding, border, and margin properties affect an element?

The CSS box model is a container that contains multiple properties including content, borders, margin,and padding. It defines how elements will render on the web page properly.

Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear.
Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent.
Border - A border that goes around the padding and content.
Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent.

- Here is an ideal example to understand the CSS box model better.
 
```
 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <html>
 <head>
      <title>CSS Box Model</title>
      <style type="text/css">

      .main {
        font-size: 40px;
        font-weight: bold;
        margin: 40px;
      }
     .content {
        margin-left: 40px;
        border: 50px solid #F6B533;
        width: 300px;
        height: 200px;
        text-align: center;
        padding: 50px;
        align-items: center;
     }

     .content1 {
        font-size: 42px;
        font-weight: bold;
        color: #E8948D;
        margin-top: 40px;
        background-color: black;
     }

       .content2 {
        font-size: 18px;
        font-weight: italic;
        color: #E8948D;
        margin-top: 40px;
        background-color: black;
       }
       </style>
 </head>
      <body>
       <div class = "main">CSS BOX-MODEL PROPERTY</div>
       <div class = "content align="center">
       <div class = "content1">content of the web page</div>
       <div class = "content2">World's best mentor with certified online provider for learning web-devlopment courses as online.</div>
       </div>
      </body>
 </html>
